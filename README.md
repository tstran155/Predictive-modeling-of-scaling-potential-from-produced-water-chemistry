# Regression and predictive modeling of time series sales data

Rossmann is one of the largest drugstore chains in Europe with over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. Accurate prediction of sales depends largely on stores' unique circumstances and the timing of the prediction. In this notebook, I built machine leaning and neural network models to regress historical sales data and predict daily sales for 1115 Rossmann stores in Germany. 

The dataset used in this work can be found on Kaggle website.
